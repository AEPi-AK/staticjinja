This project is very small, and there's lot of room for improvement. If you'd like to contribute, here's a quick guide:

1. Make an issue describing what you wish to fix.
2. Fork the repo.
3. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on me. I like to at least comment on, if not accept, pull requests within three business days (and, typically, one business day). I may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

- If relevant, include tests that fail without your code and pass with it.
- Update all documentation that would be affected by your contribution.
- Ideally, make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.

(#99999) Make the example in CONTRIBUTING imperative and concrete

Without this patch applied the example commit message in the CONTRIBUTING
document is not a concrete example.  This is a problem because the
contributor is left to imagine what the commit message should look like
based on a description rather than an example.  This patch fixes the
problem by making the example concrete and imperative.

The first line is a real life imperative statement with a ticket number
from our issue tracker.  The body describes the behavior without the patch,
why this is a problem, and how the patch fixes the problem when applied.

```

Syntax:

- PEP8
